## Leetcode 26- Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array(JavaScript)
#### Problem: Read at [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/)

In short we have to edit the existing array **(no you cannot initialize new array to store output )** and  return `k` (number of dublicate items)

#### Example:

**Input**: nums = [1,1,2]

**Output**: 2, nums = [1,2,_]

## Solution: 

Althogh this problem looks scary at first glance, it's not that hard once you understand how to solve it.
Here we will use sliding window technique to solve this problem.

### Pseudocode:
#### Assume that our array is assending order

1. Initialize `l = 1` to represent left side of the window
2. Initialize `r = 1` to represent right side 

2. Start `for` loop to iterate through every elemnt of array
3. Now we basically check current element of array with one step left side of the array
4. If they are not same (unique)
5.  We change our element at left to current right elemt and increase left by 1
6. At the end of for loop, we have number of unique values at `l`

## Algorithm:

```js
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var removeDuplicates = function(nums) {
    let l = 1
    for(let r = 1; r < nums.length; r++){
        if(nums[r] != nums[r-1]){
            nums[l] = nums[r]
            l = l + 1
        }
    }
    return l
};
```
Well Done !!!
