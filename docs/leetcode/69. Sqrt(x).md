## 69. Sqrt(x) LeetCode Solution Javascript

##### Problem: Read it at the [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/sqrtx/)

### Solution:
Here we are going to use BST (Binary Search Technique). Basically we divide our problem in half (Binary) and iterate this process untill the problem is solved.


### Pseudo Code:
Let us consider that we have a `x` = 10 and we have to calculate square root of that number. For that we have to check every number from `1 - 10`.

1.  define `left = 1` and `right = x`

2.  if `x` is 0, return 0 and if `x` is 1, return 1 - Base condition
3.  loop until `left` < `right` - Stopping condition
4.  calculate `mid`
5.  if mid * mid is equal to `x`, return `x`
6.  if mid * mid is more than `x` then we can eliminate the right part 
7.  if mid * mid is less than `x`then we can elimate the left part and continue to loop
8.  once the loop finishes we return `left - 1`

## Algorithm: 
```js
var mySqrt =  function(x){
    let left = 0, right = x
    if(x < 2) return x
    while(left < right){
        let mid = left + Math.floor((right - left) / 2)
        if( mid * mid === x) return mid
        else if(mid * mid > x){
            right = mid 
        }
        else if(mid * mid < x){
            left = mid + 1
        }
    }
    return left - 1     // remember while loop stops at left = mid + 1 
}
```
